Install the required dependencies and set up the VR environment.
Import the vr_object_interaction module into your VR application script.
Initialize the object interaction system.
Continuously capture hand tracking data from the VR controllers or hand tracking device.
Pass the captured data to the detect_interaction(data) function.
The function will detect the type of interaction (e.g., grab, throw) and the object being interacted with.
Use the detected information to simulate the interaction in the VR world, applying realistic physics and object manipulation.
